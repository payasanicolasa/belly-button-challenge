# Belly Button Biodiversity
<br>
##Description<br>
This is an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset (samples.json), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.<br>
<br>
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.<br>
<br>
The dashboard displays four elements:<br>
1. Dropdown menu displaying each test subject's identification number - You may filter the elements below by selecting a test subject id<br>
2. Text box  displaying the meta data for each test subject
3. Bar chart displaying the most frequent OTUs in each subject's navel<br>
4. Scatter/Bubble chart displaying the prevalence of each OTU by the desired subject ID<br>
<br>
